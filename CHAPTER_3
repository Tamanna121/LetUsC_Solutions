# [Chapter 3: Decision Control Instruction] Solutions

## [A]

    (a) garbage 200

    (b) 300 200

    (c) no output

    (d) x and y are equal

    (e) x=10 y=10 z=0

    (f) C is WOW

## [B]

    (a)ERROR == this is missing in if statement

    (b) NO ERROR.

    (c) NO ERROR.

    (d) There is no keyword "then" related to if in C & no variable defined here in program as well.

    (e) lvalue required as left operand of assignment.

    (f) There should be a space between else and if, as there is no "elseif" syntax in C,"else if" exists.

    (g) "&" Operator is missing before variables "a" and "b".

 ## [C]
 
    (a)True
    (b)True
    (c)True
    (d)True
    (e)True
    (f)True       

## [D]


(a) Multiples statements         - [9] sequence
(b) Else block                   - [8] if-else
(c) ;                            - [7] null statement
(d) <> <= >= == !=               - [3] relational operator
(e) ==                           - [2] comparison operator
(f) +-*/%                        - [6] arithmetic operator
(g) =                            - [1] assignment operator
(h) Default control instruction  - [4] optional
(i) Decision control instruction - [5] {}
