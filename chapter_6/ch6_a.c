(a) The break statement is used to exit from:
-> A for loop

(b)A do-while loop is useful when we want that the statement within the loop must be executed :  
-> At least once

(c)
In what sequence the initialization, testing and execution of body is done in a do - while loop ?->Intialization, execution of body, testing

(d) Which of the following is not an infinite loop? ->int t = 0,f;
       while (t)
        {
          f = 1;
         }

(e)Which of the following statement is true for the following program?
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x=10,y=100%90;
    for(i=1;i<=10;i++);
    if(x!=y);
    printf("x=%d y=%d\n",x,y);
    return 0;
}
->The program will not produce any output.

(f)Which of the following statement is true about a for loop used in a C program?
->for loop works faster than a do-while loop.
